# Aumni Selenium [Jonathan Mirabile]

This project is a Java Selenium test framework using the Page Object Model design pattern with TestNG as the testing framework. 

## Project Notes

* Code dependencies are managed by Maven. 
* Currently, the test framework targets the Google Chrome browser (V.92) and has a bundled Chromedriver to match. 
  * To target a different version of Chrome,  replace the `chromedriver.exe` in the `/driver` folder with the chromedriver that matches your version of Chrome.
  * Chromedriver can be downloaded [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
